Please complete the following c++ coding question.

Q1. Given the shfe L2 data, build a full ladder book. For example, every snapshot is in the following form,
	Snapshot
			Ask5
			Ask4
			Ask3
			Ask2
			Ask1
		Bid1
		Bid2
		Bid3
		Bid4
		Bid5
	You need to consolidate the streaming snapshot and create incremental changes applying to your book. Eventually, the book will gets longer as the following,
	Book at time t:
			AskM
			...
			Ask5
			Ask4
			Ask3
			Ask2
			Ask1
		Bid1
		Bid2
		Bid3
		Bid4
		Bid5
		...
		BidN


Requirements:
	1. please write and compile code with cmake with c++20 standard and gcc-12
	2. share the compilation environment in conda environment yaml file if possible
	3. please attach the memory footprints and program function call profiles	
	4. the book shall be in the form with each ladders (price, qty, num of orders), and each individual orders (order1, order2, order3, ..., orderN). Each order shall at least with the following fields,
		struct Order{
			uint32_t quantity,
			uint32_t queue_position,
			uint64_t last_modification_time
		};
	5. please write efficient onBookChange callback and an API to query large orders (> x quantities) within 10 levels from BBO.

Note:
	the data is given in hdf5 format. you might dump hdf5 to csv or write a c++ hdf5 parser to further speed up the program.

你你你:
写好代码后，他们对这个代码进行提问

你你你:
为什么要这样设计，对性能有哪些好处。设计中有哪些不足的等等
